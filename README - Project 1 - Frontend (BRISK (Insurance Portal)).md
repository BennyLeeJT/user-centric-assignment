# Project's Name : BRISK

>> Assignment1-User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project
My project is called "BRISK". It is a resource center that is focused on all matters pertaining to Insurance, to provide adequate information fast with a search.


## UX
 
This website is for both professionals and for the layman wanting to learn a particular subject or topic and be in the know.

The Wireframe diagram that I come up with filenames "Wireframe page_1.png, Wireframe page_2.png and Wireframe page_3.png" are stored in a separate folder name Wireframe.

The Strategy & Scope that I come up with filename "Strategy & Scope.pdf" is stored in a separate folder name Strategy & Scope.

The Structure diagram that I come up with filename "Structure Insurance Portal.jpeg" is stored in a separate folder name Structure.

    
## Features
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows user to fill in a form to let insurance professionals contact them for their insurance needs)


### Features Left to Implement
Feature ideas would be :
- to display eye catchy news ticker that scrolls as well as changing of images

- to display a library of terms, terminology and information to long articles


## Technologies Used
- HTML5 : The markup language used for this frontend project

- CSS3 : The styling
